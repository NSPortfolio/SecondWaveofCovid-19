         <tr>
           <td><p style = "font-size:20px;"> The second wave is largely due to human behavior, not more testing. As the first spike of Covid seemed to have been eradicated, public areas were re-opened and operated normally but proper precautions such as social distancing and mask-wearing were not always taken. This resulted in a surge of new cases, otherwise known as a new wave, from areas that were not hit previously but are now. </p>

           <td><h1 style = "background-color: RoyalBlue;font-family:georgia;color:white;text-align:center;padding:10px">Where did the second wave already hit?</h1></td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
           <td><p style = "font-size:20px;"> The dip in Covid outbreaks and the subsidence of the first spike in Europe was the invitation to before-Covid life. Masks were still required, but public transportation, gathering, and office life resumed. By the end of late December, Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium found themselves in the onus of a national lockdown, stalling till the vaccine arrived. </p>
